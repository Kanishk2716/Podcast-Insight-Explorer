{"transcription": " There is no love, to be very honest. It's all about hormones. That hype is created, oh my god! There is no love, there is no real love. There is attraction, there is excitement and love is not like that. If you feel that kind of excitement all the time, that there is always madness going on and there is a lot of anxiety, that's not love. What is love? Love is actually peace. Peace. when you are feeling very satisfied when you are feeling that no matter what I can rely on this person and specially when things go wrong"}
